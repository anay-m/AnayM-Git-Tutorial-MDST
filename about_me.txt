Tell us your name, year, school, major (if you are undecided, write down the frontrunners), and a fun fact!

Hi, my name is Anay Modi. I am a freshman from Troy, Michigan studying Computer Science at the College of Engineering. My fun fact is that I am obsessed with college football. I know every player on the Michigan football team, and I know almost everything is going on with the rest of the best college teams around the country. Let me know if anyone wants to go to a game with me!
